# Wordle Solver

Currently, the dictionary/trie is not generated correctly for some reason.
 - OSPD5 words do not appear as leaves
 - I suspect weights for branches are also incorrect, but not sure

Need to write the solver code based on the json/pickle file of the generated trie.

âš  Runtime for charfreq.py is maybe on the order of 10 minutes.
